#NomadMap.io

A currently hacked-together MVP, this is intended as a community-backed effort to aggregate places relevant to digital nomads.

Currently it's using a simple JS script to plots points on a custom Google Maps instance, from data provided by publicly editable Google Sheets spreadsheet.

##Getting Involved

The application is currently backed by publicly editable Google Sheets. I can only assume this won't scale well long-term, but for now it should do the trick. If you don't see your favorite place on the map feel free to add it to the appropriate country spreadsheet and city tab with as much information as possible below, with as much information as you can gander. GPS coordinates _are_ required, otherwise the point won't appear on the map.

###Spreadsheets

###Getting GPS Coords

As Google Maps location data can be fickle in many non-Western countries, I'd recommend verifying it in the satellite view or from a phone GPS when possible. When you click on a point in Google Maps a small info window will appear at the bottom with latitude/longitude, or you can pull the coords directly out of the browser URL.

Example Coords: `10.082283,99.840424`
